# Sends a command to the test device. syntax: ./sendcmd cmd,args,jid,times 
#
# Information about available commands and the accepted arguments for each of those can be found in the device source and header files, to note it down:
#
# CRYPTO_AES:       (command = 0),  args will be interpreted as the subtest to be run, if decryption is requested (1) a jid (job id) is expected,
#                                   and it needs to be the id of the job holding the previous encryption. Available modes:
#                                        * ECB = 0
#                                        * CBC = 1
#                                        * CTR = 2
#                                   
# CRYPTO_TDES:      (command = 1),  args will be interpreted as the subtest to be run, if decryption is requested (1) a jid (job id) is expected,
#                                   and it needs to be the id of the job holding the previous encryption. Available modes:
#                                        * DES ECB = 3  (8 Bytes key)
#                                        * DES CBC = 4  (8 Bytes key)
#                                        * DDES ECB = 5 (16 Bytes key)
#                                        * DDES CBC = 6 (16 Bytes key)
#                                        * TDES ECB = 7 (24 Bytes key)
#                                        * TDES CBC = 8 (24 Bytes key)
#
# CRYPTO_CRC:       (command = 2),  args will be interpreted as the subtest to be run, if update is requested (1) a jid (job id) is expected,
#                                   and it needs to be the id of the job holding the previous updates. No mode expected.
# CRYPTO_DIVX:      (command = 3),  No args expected. No mode expected.
#
# For all the commands above, if "times" parameter is provided the test will be run in parallel as many times as demanded.
